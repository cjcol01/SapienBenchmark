# Sapien Benchmark Flask Webapp
This is a flask webapp based on the website ```https://humanbenchmark.com/```  
Sapien Benchmark was previously hosted at ```http://sapienbenchmark.com``` on Amazon Web Services. For cost reasons, the site was taken down and can now only be accessed locally  

A showcase video demonstrating the website and key parts of the code is included at https://github.com/cjcol01/SapienBenchmark/blob/main/CJ_Coleman_video.mp4  
However, it will have to be downloaded as it is too large to play on github
